# CRTP-Notes

This repository contains my notes while preparing for the CRTP (Certified Red Team Pentesting) exam. These notes were a valuable resource during my study sessions, helping me reinforce critical concepts and improve my understanding of various red teaming and penetration testing topics.

Please note that these notes are based on my understanding and may only be comprehensive or suitable for some. They are intended to supplement other study materials and should not be considered a standalone resource for exam preparation.
